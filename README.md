## Summary
Dartscore is a simple darts scoring web app written in React. It can be used to score a game of [Cricket](https://www.dartslive.com/beginner/en/cricket/) or [301](https://www.dartslive.com/beginner/en/01/) darts for 2-4 players. It runs on any browser and is written with a mobile-first approach - very handy when the pub is out of chalk!

This project is one of two primary portfolio pieces I created at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Brooklyn during the Fall of 2024. The site can be accessed at [dartscore.vercel.app](https://dartscore.vercel.app/).
